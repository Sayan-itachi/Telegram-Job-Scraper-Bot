# Telegram-Job-Scraper-Bot
This Python script, scrapping_job.py, automatically scrapes job listings from specified public Telegram channels and posts them to your own Telegram channel in a structured, formatted manner. It leverages Selenium for headless browsing and parsing, and uses the python-telegram-bot library to deliver messages.
